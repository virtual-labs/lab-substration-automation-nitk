The assembly of apparatus used to change some characteristics (e.g. voltage, frequency, p.f., A.C. to D.C. etc.) of an electrical supply is called a substation.</br></br>Some of the main operations of substations are:</br></br>To receive energy transmitted at high voltage from the generating stations.</br>To decrease the voltage to a value appropriate for local distribution.</br>To provide switching facilities.",
